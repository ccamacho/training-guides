How to prepare
==============

* Make sure you have a wifi enabled laptop with you.
* Download the prepared virtual machine image and some environment
  for running the image (We suggest VirtualBox):

  * Image: http://bit.ly/vm-2018-berlin-v1

* Optional: Prepare an environment by yourself from scratch:

  * Create a virtual machine on your laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 installed and
    6+ GB of RAM.
  * Alternatively, you can use your virtual machine on a public cloud.
  * Check that you can ssh from your laptop to the virtual machine
  * Check that :command:`apt install` works on the virtual machine
  * Read and complete the
    `Setup IRC <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/irc.html>`_
    guide.

.. note::
   Aside from the Setup IRC section above, we will cover everything else that is in
   `the Contributor Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ during the class.
